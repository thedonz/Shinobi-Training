> "Software is created in your head"

No project is an island. Software can't be built or perform in isolation.

The two most imporant modern skills are **Communication Skills** and **Learning & Thinking Skills**.

You don't get taught, you have to learn. We tend to look at the teacher/learner relationship the wrong way around: It's not that the teacher _teaches_; it's that the student _learns_. The learning is always up to you.

The essence of _pragmatism_ is to do what works -- for you.

> "When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe." -- John Muir, 1911, _My First Summer in the Sierra_.

In systems thinking, one tries to envision an object as a connection point of several systems, rather than, as a discrete object unto itself.

Notes:

_"The Essence of Pragmatism is to do what works for you."_
_"Nothing exists in isolation; everything is part of the system and part of a larger context."_

Talking out loud, writing the material down and thinking about it  are NOT the same in the brain. They are processed through different neural pathways and can all be used interchangeably to increase retention of the material.

Interesting thought: This book is a lot more philosophical than you'd imagine at first glance.

### ALWAYS CONSIDER CONTEXT. ###
