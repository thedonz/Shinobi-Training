# Noteworthy Notes
### Getting Things Done by David Allen

Interesting excerpts from the book. Things to pay extra attention to.

> It is possible to be effectively _doing_ while you are delightfully _being_, in your ordinary workaday world.

> “It's possible for a person to have an overwhelming number of things to do and still function productively with a clear head and a positive sense of relaxed control.”

> “Anxiety is caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation, and action. —David Kekich”

Two key objectives:

1. Capturing _all_ the things that need to get done-now, later someday, big little or in between- into a logical and trusted system outside of your head and off your mind.

2. Disciplining yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the "inputs" you let into your life so that you will always have a plan for "next actions" that you can implement or renegotiate at any moment.

_"What will you do when you're not saving the world?"_ Hans Zimmer, Man Of Steel.
