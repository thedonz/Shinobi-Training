# HTML Boilerplate Transcription

### Here is the breakdown of each HTML element in the `index.html` file for the _HTML5 Boilerplate Project._

* `<!DOCTYPE html>` [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/Introduction_to_HTML5) - Used to indicate that your HTML content uses HTML 5. Doing so will cause even browsers that don't presently support HTML5 to ender into standards mode, which means that they'll interpret the long-established parts of HTML in an HTML5-compliant way while ignoring the new features of HTML5 they don't support.

* `<head>` [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head) - provides general information (metadata) about the document, including its title and links to or definitions of scripts and style sheets.
EXAMPLE:
```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>"That's no moon..."</title>
```
